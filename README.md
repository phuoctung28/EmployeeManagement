# EmployeeManagement
My first assignment
My program is to manage the information of the employees that inport from the keyboard

        printf("=============== MENU ===============");
        printf("\n0. Show current list.");
        printf("\n1. Add employees to the list.");
        printf("\n2. Show the employees list.");
        printf("\n3. Sort employees.");
        printf("\n4. Find employees information");
        printf("\n5. Write employees's information to file");
        printf("\n6. Exit");
 *Unresolved problems:- First time using file technique. READ WRITE IN THE SAME TIME :)
