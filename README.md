# EmployeeManagement
My first assignment

        printf("=============== MENU ===============");
        printf("\n0. Show current list.");
        printf("\n1. Add employees to the list.");
        printf("\n2. Show the employees list.");
        printf("\n3. Sort employees.");
        printf("\n4. Find employees information");
        printf("\n5. Write employees's information to file");
        printf("\n6. Exit");
 *Unresolved problems: - First time using file technique so execution doesn't smooth like I thoughted.
                      - Need to add more clear screen to make it more clarify.
                      - Clean code. How to name a variable.
                      - How to use pointer in the rightways.
                      - Do I need to build a PC
